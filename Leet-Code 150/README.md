# 🚀 LeetCode Progress

I have solved **LeetCode 150** across various patterns and difficulty levels.  
This journey helped me strengthen my **problem-solving, algorithms, and data structure skills**.  

## 📌 What I’ve Learned So Far
- **Arrays & Strings** → Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Prefix/Suffix, Hashing  
- **Linked List** → Fast & Slow Pointers, Reversal, Cycle Detection  
- **Stack & Queue** → Monotonic Stack, Min/Max Queue, BFS/DFS traversal  
- **Recursion & Backtracking** → Subsets, Permutations, Combinations, N-Queens  
- **Binary Search** → on Answer, Rotated Arrays, Peak Element  
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)** → Fibonacci, Knapsack, Grid Paths, LIS, LCS  
- **Graphs** → BFS, DFS, Topological Sort, Union Find, Dijkstra  
- **Math & Bit Manipulation** → GCD/LCM, Prime Sieve, XOR tricks  

## 🎯 Next Goals
- Reach **300+ problems** milestone  
- Master **Advanced DP & Graphs**  
- Improve **speed + accuracy** for contests
